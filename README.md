    assert_perform_under(1) { sleep 0.1 }
  end

  def test_ultra_fast
    assert_perform_under_ns(1) do
      # do ultra fast
    end
  end
end
```

### TimeUnit Shorthand

```ruby
class BenchmarkTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
  using ::Test::Unit::Benchmark::TimeUnitShorthand
  def test_ultra_fast
    assert_perform_under(1.ns) do
      # do ultra fast
    end
  end
end
```
